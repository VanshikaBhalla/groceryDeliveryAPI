## Drawbacks and Challenges

While developing the on-demand grocery delivery service, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **User Experience:** Feedback indicated that the user interface could be more intuitive, prompting future iterations for improvement.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Encountered difficulties with API integration and testing, which required additional time and troubleshooting.
- **Data Storage:** I used CSV files for storage, which is straightforward for initial development but may not be optimal for larger datasets.

These challenges have provided valuable lessons, and I look forward to addressing them in future projects.

## Acknowledgements

After overcoming initial challenges, the application has been successfully deployed on Render, ensuring scalability to meet varying demands. This project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am grateful for the learning opportunities the project provided.
